  <h1>Criminal Case Solver</h1>

    <h5>
      You're a famous detective and you've been called into town to solve a case. Seems like this particular criminal left clues to his next victim. The clues say the next location the criminal will attack is Cross Street but there is no address. The police don't seem too interested in figuring out the clue and the commissioner seems to be ignoring you and went to the rooftop. On a USB drive you've found a document with a large list of numbers and in several different places you've found clues as to what the numbers mean.
